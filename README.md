# Hi there, I'm gizmocology (Gizmotech) 👋

I am a DIY enthusiast and maker focused on sustainability, microcontrollers, and creative engineering. My work revolves around turning waste into functional technology and exploring the boundaries of hobbyist engineering.

## 🛠 Currently Working On: The PET Strip Trilogy
I'm developing a series of filtration and growth systems based on precision-cut recycled PET strips (1mm, 3mm, 5mm).

- **[Recycled PET Strip Pond Filter](https://github.com/gizmocology/recycled-pet-strip-pond-filter)** - Up-flow vortex filtration for crystal clear fish ponds.
- **[Recycled PET Strip Domestic Filtration](https://github.com/gizmocology/recycled-pet-strip-domestic-filtration)** - Hybrid water treatment for city water supply.
- **[Recycled PET Strip Aquaponics System](https://github.com/gizmocology/recycled-pet-strip-aquaponics-system)** - Sustainable food production with a pilot project of 100 chili polybags.

## 🚁 Other Tech Interests
Beyond water treatment, I spend my time building and experimenting with:
- **RC Aviation:** Designing slow flyers and analyzing differential/vector thrust.
- **CNC & Plotters:** Custom-built pen plotters and laser cutters for single-line art.
- **3D Printing:** Recycling PET bottles into 3D printer filament.
- **Microcontrollers:** IoT projects using ESP32, ESP8266, and Arduino.
